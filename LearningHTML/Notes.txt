# Theory

~> HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language
~> It's a type of Markup Language
~> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
~> HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
~> HTML describes the structure of a Web page
~> HTML consists of a series of elements
~> HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
~> HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

~> Invetors:
    1989	Tim Berners-Lee invented www
    1991	Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML
~> Web Browsers:
    The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
    A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

~> Syntax:
    <OpeningTag attribute="attributeValues"> ... Content </ClosingTag>
    Opeing and closing tags must have same name and shall be like Braces in opeing and closing hierarchy.
    void element syntax:  <TagName> or <TagName/>

~> HTML files extensions can either be .html or .htm

~> Command to start HTML files:
    start "file_path_and_name.html"

~> Structure:
    - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
    - The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    - The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
    - The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)

~> Comments
    HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
    Single or multiline based on need can be written using same syntax
    Syntax: <!-- Commented Content -->

~> The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

~> View HTML Source Code:
    Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, or right-click on the page and select "View Page Source".
    This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page.

~> HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
    All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
    Never Skip the End Tag
    Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag
    Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag.

~> Empty HTML Elements
    Also called Void or self-closing elements.
    HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
    Without a closing Tag.

~>  HTML is Not Case Sensitive
    HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
    But lowercase is recommended for differen purposes tags as well as attributes.

~> HTML Attributes
    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

~> Tooltip in HTML:
    The title Attribute
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
    The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element

~> <p> paragraph tag always tart with a new line.
~> Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
~> <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier)
~> CSS attribute syntax: <tagname style="property:value;">
    The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:

~> Formatting:
    Visual Styling: <b>, <i>, <u>, <mark>, <small>, <sub>, <sup>
    Semantic Emphasis: <strong>, <em>, <del>, <ins>, <abbr>, <cite>
    Code/Technical: <code>, <kbd>, <samp>, <var>, <pre>
    Quoting: <blockquote>, <q>, <cite>
    Direction/Control: <bdo>, <br>, <hr>, <span>, <div>
    Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
        <b> - Bold text
        <strong> - Important text
        <i> - Italic text
        <em> - Emphasized text
        <mark> - Marked text
        <small> - Smaller text
        <del> - Deleted text
        <ins> - Inserted text (filled in)
        <sub> - Subscript text
        <sup> - Superscript text

~> Quotation and Citation:
    The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
    Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
    
    The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
    Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

    <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
    Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
    Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.

    The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
    The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

    The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
    Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.
    The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

~> <bdo> tags:
    BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.
    The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:

~> HTML Colors:
    HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.
    HTML supports 140 standard color names.
    In HTML, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values.
    Types of specifications
        Predefined Color Names:
            common names of colors.
            lowercase only preffered.
            Format:     colorNames
            Exammple:   red, blue, green, yellow, cyan, magenta, black, white, gray, etc.
        RGB (Red Green Blue):
            Three numbers ranging from 0-255 one for each red-green-blue.
            This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors.
            rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red
            rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green
            rgb(0, 0, 255) is displayed as blue
            rgb(0, 0, 0) is displayed as black
            rgb(255, 255, 255) is displayed as white
            Format:     rgb(red, green, blue)
            Example:    rgb(255, 0, 0)
        RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)
            Three numbers ranging from 0-255 one for each red-green-blue.
            This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors.
            rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red

            rgb(0, 0, 0) is displayed as black
            rgb(255, 255, 255) is displayed as white
            Alpha controls transparency (0 is fully transparent, 1 is opaque)
            Format:     rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
            Example:    rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)
        HEX (Hexadecimal):
            2 digits each for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal (00 to FF).
            #ff0000 or #f00 is displayed red

            Shorthand (only when pairs are repeated):    #f00
        HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
            Hue is the color of paint you choose
            Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue like (VIBGYOR).
            Saturation is how much color pigment vs gray is in it.
            Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
            Lightness is how much white or black you mix with it.
            Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.
            Hue: 0 to 360 (angle on color wheel)
            Saturation: 0% (gray) to 100% (full color)
            Lightness: 0% (black) to 100% (white)
            Format: hsl(hue, saturation%, lightness%)
            Example:    hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
        HSLA (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha)
            Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
            Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

            Saturation: 0% (gray) to 100% (full color)
            Lightness: 0% (black) to 100% (white)
            Alpha controls transparency (0 is fully transparent, 1 is opaque)
            Format: hsla(hue, saturation%, lightness%, alpha)
            Example:    hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5)

~> HTML Links:
    HTML links are hyperlinks.
    When we move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a pointer(little hand).
    A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!
    Links are found in nearly all web pages.
    Links allow users to click their way from page to page.
    By default all hyperlinks (<a> tags) are underlined.
    Colors:
        An unvisited link is underlined and blue, changed using css pseudo class :link
        A visited link is underlined and purple, changed using css pseudo class :visited
        An active link is underlined and red, changed using css pseudo class :active or :hover is also used sometimes.
        Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look!
    target Attribute:
        The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
        The target attribute can have one of the following values:
            _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
            _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
            _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
            _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
    Absolute URL:
        Absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
    Local URL:
        A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):
    we use "text-decoration:none;" CSS property to remove underlines.
    JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button, turninig them into link sometimes.
    Using Id of an element in href #idName is termed as Bookmarks in HTML 
    Syntax: <a href="url">link text</a>

~> Favicons:
    A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.
    Create custom favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc.
    Place it in the head after title tag.
    Syntax: <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">

~> Title tag ( <title> ):
    defines a title in the browser toolbar
    provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    displays a title for the page in search engine-results
